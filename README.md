# Dead Internet Observatory

**Tracking and quantifying the synthetic takeover of the public internet**

The [Dead Internet Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory) holds that the internet is increasingly populated by bots, AI-generated content, and automated engagement farms rather than real humans.

This project is a living observatory that computes an **Internet Aliveness Index (IAI)** — a 0–100 score measuring how much of the sampled public internet still looks authentically human. Bots pull from 14 data sources, run a battery of statistical detection signals on every document, and aggregate everything into a daily index served through a Streamlit dashboard.

No paid model APIs or subscriptions. Detection runs locally with classical NLP
signals plus optional DistilGPT-2 perplexity scoring.

## The Dashboard

> Live at: **[deadinternetobservatory.streamlit.app](https://deadinternetobservatory.streamlit.app/)**

- IAI gauge with live score and delta vs. 2019 baseline
- Platform health bars across all active sources
- Methodology and signal weights

## How the Index Works

The IAI uses seven classical linguistic and behavioural signals:

| Signal | Weight | What it's catching |
|---|---|---|
| **Type-Token Ratio** | 18% | Narrow vocabulary is a classic AI tell |
| **Shannon Entropy** | 15% | AI text has lower information density |
| **Sentence Length Variance** | 15% | AI writes unnaturally uniform sentences |
| **Bigram Repetition** | 15% | Stock phrase reuse, templated content |
| **Temporal Burstiness** | 15% | Bots post on schedules; humans don't |
| **MTLD** | 12% | Length-independent lexical diversity |
| **Zipf Law Alignment** | 10% | Natural language follows a power law; AI text deviates |

All signals are statistical. No external model calls, no GPU required. Everything runs on standard CPU in Python.

For non-Common-Crawl documents, the pipeline also runs DistilGPT-2 locally and
assigns perplexity 15% of the score; the seven classical weights are scaled
proportionally. Common Crawl disables perplexity to stay within workflow time limits.

**Where data lives:**
- Raw JSONL (bronze) → GitHub Artifacts, normally 7-day retention; Common Crawl uses 1 day
- Processed Parquet (silver/gold) → [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jupiternull/dead-internet-observatory)
- Daily index aggregates → Hugging Face `observatory.db`
- Scored doc registry → Hugging Face `gold/doc_registry.parquet`

---

## Data Privacy and Security

The collectors only access publicly available pages and public APIs. Published
Silver and Gold Parquet files contain full collected text and may include stable
public account identifiers, URLs, titles, domains, timestamps, and personal or
sensitive information embedded in public content. Collection does not sanitize
or redact these fields before publication.

- Secrets are supplied through GitHub Actions secrets or environment variables.
- Credentials are never required by the public Streamlit dashboard.
- `.env`, key, certificate, and Streamlit secret files are excluded from git.
- GitHub secret scanning, push protection, private vulnerability reporting, and
  Dependabot vulnerability alerts are enabled for this repository.
- Forks must use their own credentials and must not publish them in configuration files.

To request removal of a dataset record, open a GitHub issue containing only its
`doc_id`. Do not post sensitive text or personal details. Credential exposures
and other security issues should use the repository's private vulnerability
reporting form under the **Security** tab. Removal from prior Hugging Face
commits may require a separate history rewrite.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jupiternull/dead-internet-observatory
cd dead-internet-observatory
pip install -r requirements-streamlit.txt
streamlit run app/app.py
```

The dashboard reads the published SQLite snapshot from Hugging Face. To run data collection locally, see below.

## Running Real Data Collection

```bash
# Individual minions
python3 -m minions.reddit_bot
python3 -m minions.news_crawler_bot
python3 -m minions.wikipedia_bot
python3 -m minions.hackernews_bot
python3 -m minions.bluesky_bot
python3 -m minions.fourchan_bot
python3 -m minions.steam_bot
python3 -m minions.youtube_bot
python3 -m minions.linkedin_bot
python3 -m minions.stackoverflow_bot
python3 -m minions.mastodon_bot
python3 -m minions.github_bot
python3 -m minions.wayback_bot        # slow — fetches 5 years of snapshots
python3 -m minions.common_crawl_bot   # heavy — downloads WET files

# Run the full pipeline after harvesting
python3 -m pipeline.bronze_ingestion
python3 -m pipeline.silver_processing

# Publish to your Hugging Face dataset repository
HF_TOKEN=... python3 scripts/push_to_hf.py --repo owner/dataset
```

---

## Deployment

**Streamlit Community Cloud (free):**
1. Fork this repo
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) → New app → point to `app/app.py`
3. Deploy — Streamlit reads the public Hugging Face dataset snapshot and needs no secrets

By default, a fork displays the upstream `jupiternull/dead-internet-observatory`
dataset. For an independent deployment, create a Hugging Face dataset repository
and replace the dataset ID in `app/app.py`, `scripts/push_to_hf.py`, and
`.github/workflows/pipeline_and_index.yml`.

**Activating autonomous data collection (GitHub Actions):**
1. Enable Actions and scheduled workflows on the fork
2. Pre-create the Hugging Face dataset repository
3. Add a write-capable `HF_TOKEN` for dataset publication
4. Add `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` to enable YouTube collection
5. Optionally add `STACKOVERFLOW_API_KEY` for higher Stack Exchange quotas

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is supplied automatically by GitHub Actions. Supabase and
`DATABASE_URL` are no longer used.

Never commit these values. Add them under repository **Settings → Secrets and
variables → Actions**.

Dependency files are split by runtime:
- `requirements-streamlit.txt` — dashboard deployment
- `requirements-minions.txt` — source collectors
- `requirements-pipeline.txt` — processing, scoring, and Hugging Face publication
- `requirements.txt` — full superset kept for existing deployment compatibility

## Contributing

This is a living project. A few things that would move the needle:

- **Better signal weights** — calibrate against labeled human/AI datasets (HC3, RAID, M4 on HF)
- **New minions** — Internet Archive bulk data, academic paper feeds, forum scrapers
- **Perplexity calibration** — benchmark DistilGPT-2 scoring against labeled corpora
- **Anomaly alerts** — webhook or email when the IAI drops more than X points in a day
